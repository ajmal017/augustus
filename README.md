# augustus
A backtesting and quantitative trading library in Python3

Augustus is a student project which aims to be a backtesting library and a quantitative trading system for traders based on event-driven engine. Now it is in an actively early development stage.
The environment I recommend for developing Augustus is:
- Anaconda 3.7.0+
- MongoDB 4.0.3+
