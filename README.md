# augustus
A quantitative backtest and algorithm trading library in Python3

Augustus is a student project which aims to be a backtest library and algorithm trading system for quantitative traders based on event-driven engine. Now it is in an actively early development stage.
The environment I recommend (which I am using) for developing Augustus is:
- Anaconda 3.7.0+
- MongoDB 4.0.3+
